Welcome to my page!

I'm [Swarup](https://swarup-rj.github.io).

ðŸ’¡ As a Senior Data Scientist and Researcher, I specialize in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Audio, and Computer Vision, with a strong focus on foundation models and efficient architectures. My work spans multiple industries, including sports, telecommunications, healthcare, legal, and oil & gas, where I leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and Audio/Vision Foundation Models to drive cutting-edge advancements.

ðŸ”¬ My research is centered on fundamental challenges in audio intelligence, including (i) Speech and Audio Processing, (ii) Audio Deepfake Detection, (iii) Behavioral Signal Processing, and (iv) Anti-Spoofing. Through a combination of novel architectures, representation learning, and robustness-driven methodologies, I aim to push the boundaries of audio and multimodal AI.

ðŸŽ“ Recognized with the Best Research Award at OSUSAAC 2020, my Ph.D. work involved analyzing cricket player performance through real-time ball-by-ball text commentary, combining cutting-edge AI with sports analytics. I am well-versed in tools like Python, R, MATLAB, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, which I use to develop scalable solutions and publish research in top venues such as ICMLA, ESANN, ECML-PKDD, CMSAC, IJCNN, INTERSPEECH, and ICASSP.

âœ¨ Additionally, completed an M.Tech degree in CSE from IIT Guwahati, excelling in a fascinating convex optimization problem - 'spectral clustering using convex and constrained settings'.
